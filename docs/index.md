## Origins

Miniventure started as a remake of [Minicraft Plus](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived), in a desire to start fresh after learning from the mistakes made in development. However, now, Miniventure has taken a direction all its own, and I fully intend to make and release it as an entirely independent game, with only basic similarities.

## Features

#### Miniventure is still in relatively early development despite it being in alpha for a year and a half now. It should be ready for Beta soon though. Here's a list of the major features it *does* have in the meanwhile:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Procedurally generated terrain maps using noise manipulation
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - basic tool crafting and interactions
  - an update-checker that tells you when there's a new update available, and gives you the link.
  - sound effects and a little bit of music

### Notes

If you want to know what some of the current goals are in terms of development, check out the files in [notes/next-projects](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes/next-projects).

- For those goals about adding stuff, it's dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and my art skills are quite trash. So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D
