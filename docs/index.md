## Origins

Miniventure started as a remake of [Minicraft Plus](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived), in a desire to start fresh after learning from the mistakes made in development. However, now, Miniventure has taken a direction all its own, and I fully intend to make and release it as an entirely independent game, with only basic similarities.

## Features

#### Miniventure is still in relatively early development despite it being in pre-Alpha for a year and a half now.

It's in Alpha now though, so progress is happening slowly. Here's a list of the major features that *have* been implemented:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Procedurally generated terrain maps using noise manipulation
    - Current world system is a continguous "effectively infinite" map; however, Beta will have a different world layout.
  - World save/load
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - Fully malleable terrain; tiles can be broken and replaced to create your own environments
  - Basic inventory management and crafting
  - Mob AI behaviors
  - In-game chat/command overlay
  - An update-checker that tells you when there's a new update available, and gives you the link.
  - Some neat retro sound effects

### Notes

If you want to know what some of the current goals are in terms of development, check out the files in [notes/next-projects](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes/next-projects).

- For those goals about adding stuff, it's dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and my art skills are quite trash. So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D
