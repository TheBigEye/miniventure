Alpha 2.1:
	* Moved game data directory for Windows users to Documents/My Games/Miniventure
	+ Completely remade crafting system; craftables now come in two types: items, and objects. Objects are created in the world itself, instead of going into your inventory. Items go into your inventory as usual.
	+ Added better interaction with world list; compatibility issues and possible solutions will be displayed for older versions, as well as a notice when changes occur to the save format.
	+ Cursor-based interaction is more obvious by highlighting the tile that will be interacted with
	+ When constructing objects, and with some items, there is a range of a few tiles away that you can interact, instead of it always being next to the player. This is blocked by solid tiles however.

Alpha 1.2:
	+ Brand new inventory screen that is hopefully much more ergonomic than the previous screen (crafting screen overhaul coming soon)
	# Fixed a number of ui and item bugs
	* Improved input controls to allow for wasd movement and mouse interaction
	* Made saved world list sort by modification time, so recently played worlds appear highest


Alpha 1.1:
	+ Brand new terrain system consisting of islands (well, only one island right now)
	+ Save system implemented
