An integrated tutorial for first-time players. Pops up at key points to tell you how to do certain things. Consists of text being drawn places on screen, maybe some arrows, and highlighted screen areas.

why not give the player an animation holding items? Or better, use the item's sprite, and just draw it in the player's hand, in each of the player's positions. It's a possible idea, but I'm skeptical.

limited visibility; you have to explore for an area to be shown, otherwise it's black. Or, stones and stuff block the player's view.
Dither effect around the edges, perhaps.

****

it would be cool if things like trees did a little shake when you attack them... maybe rocks that are not touching any others could also do it.

****

lasers as a form of energy transport. Wiring could be a thing too, I suppose.

Underwater world / biome: requires scuba suit to access. Can dive under in ocean biomes, and explore. Coral, new enemies, etc.
