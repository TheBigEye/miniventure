ANIMATION / RENDERING

- food particle always reflects the total amount the food item normally gives, not the amount actually given if the player was already nearly full.

- debug interact bounds / draw boxes aren't fully rendering properly.

- walking animations for other mobs don't play on respawn screen

- the main menu background freezes up a bit while loading a world and while generating terrain; need to determine if this is a threading / sync issue (perhaps there are synchronized blocks causing the problem), or if it's just a matter of processor usage.
