ANIMATION / RENDERING

- food particle always reflects the total amount the food item normally gives, not the amount actually given if the player was already nearly full.

- debug interact bounds / draw boxes aren't fully rendering properly.

- walking animations for other mobs don't play on respawn screen

- the main menu background freezes up a bit while loading a world and while generating terrain; need to determine if this is a threading / sync issue (perhaps there are synchronized blocks causing the problem), or if it's just a matter of processor usage.


GAMEPLAY / MECHANICS

- knockback ignores tile collision


SAVE / LOAD

- possibly fixed - initial server load generates the islands lazily, so the initial save doesn't even have one generated. So new versions create new terrain.
    - seemingly broken: loading in as the host player doesn't seem to maintain the position that we left off in

- sometimes after loading a save, the game will periodically freeze up during play every few seconds

- sometimes after exiting a world, it fails to properly release the access lock.
