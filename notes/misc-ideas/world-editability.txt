What if I don't have to make the world 100% editable? I mean, it's a cool premise and all, but could I get more gameplay by restricting it a little bit?

what sort of experience do I want to give?
- story loosely followed, i.e. end goal
- very little *direct* hints on how to achieve it
- most of gameplay involves exploring the world and finding the resources contained within
- after finding resources, these are used to build various things; structures, wearables, tools, food, more advanced materials
- manage creatures found in the world; attack them or befriend them, or leave them alone; if they do the same with you
