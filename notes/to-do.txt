- I think a big part of the new Tile System was *supposed* to be the ability to lump DOOR_OPEN and DOOR_CLOSED, amoung other things, into the same TileType. However, I don't seem to be doing that at all. I ought to see that it happens.
 
- when menu system is done, add a volume option


- I ought to spend a bit of time, now and in the future, to redo some of the code in terms of error handling. What I currently do is make sure it breaks when something unexpected happens, but what I should do (where possible) is log that there was something unexpected, and then try to recover. Making sure the game doesn't crash during play should be a priority, but the problem should still bring attention to itself; just without crashing the game.


- give item entities shadows like the water thing
- speaking of items, maybe, for the sake of visibility, all item sprites should have a 1-pixel black outline?

- cut some decimals off of the ping time display

- display a message when a player dies (a generic one)

- log to server console when commands are used (this includes chat, since server console doesn't display chat otherwise)

- reconsider rendering rules when player is in a hole; currently clips adjacent tiles. Check if the same happens with water.
