- move known player handling from ServerWorld to GameServer; world will pass player info from WorldDataSet to server constructor.
- work on synchronization of packet handling; many packets can probably be processed when the player is updated
	- players will be updated at the normal time with the rest of the entities
	- movement requests will accumulate with the waiting for the player to be updated, and when the update occurs it will act like one movement request moving from the first request's start to the last request's end.
	- further sync notes in related txt file.

- damage bar for tiles

- add more biomes to the starter island, like a desert section (just for while we only have one island)

- add a container so people can store their items

- edit tools a bit so the early ones don't break so fast
	- I don't really want breakage to be a concern where you have to make a new tool every couple blocks destroyed.

- mob sprites, tool sprites, furnace, loom, fishing, floor tiles including carpets, chests, ores in the middle of rock formations.
- Note that item sprites should be 16x16.
 
- add a volume option for sounds

- cut some decimals off of the ping time display

- display a message when a player dies (a generic one)

- log to server console when commands are used (this includes chat, since server console doesn't display chat otherwise)

- reconsider rendering rules when player is in a hole; currently clips adjacent tiles. Check if the same happens with water.
