- specify items via a single enum that takes a creator and a loader; sub enums are a little overkill
	- also include crafting recipes for that item, if any
- make tile-based crafting system
	- i think active tile highlight is necessary
	- personal crafting menu shows mainly "blueprints"
		- these are special tile items that craft when placed
	- menu also has a couple small items that you can craft right into your inventory 
	- all other crafting recipes are shown only in the respective crafting screens

- validate world name; can only contain alphanum, spaces, dashes, and underscores

- add stuff to serverplayer
- level loading sync queue

- have a play with colorizing server console output
- echo player commands to server terminal (this includes the msg command)
	- "player": <command>

- consider converting command execution behavior param "args" to a list for easier manipulation
- consider checking if a world is sp, and circumventing the kryo server if so. Simply pass the packets without serialization.
	- do this next!

- create a dropItems method 

- move known player handling from ServerWorld to GameServer; world will pass player info from WorldDataSet to server constructor.
- work on synchronization of packet handling; many packets can probably be processed when the player is updated
	- players will be updated at the normal time with the rest of the entities
	- movement requests will accumulate with the waiting for the player to be updated, and when the update occurs it will act like one movement request moving from the first request's start to the last request's end.
	- further sync notes in related txt file.

- have mob AI's pursue their attacker instead of just the "nearest player." zombies, which are naturally aggressive, actually will seek out the nearest player, but will focus on one for a time if they attack it.
	- impl note, move getNearestPlayer method from Level to ServerLevel, so it can fetch the players on a level without having to go through all the entities on the level.

- damage bar for tiles

- add more biomes to the starter island, like a desert section (just for while we only have one island)

- add a container so people can store their items

- edit tools a bit so the early ones don't break so fast
	- I don't really want breakage to be a concern where you have to make a new tool every couple blocks destroyed.

- mob sprites, tool sprites, furnace, loom, fishing, floor tiles including carpets, chests, ores in the middle of rock formations.
- Note that item sprites should be 16x16.
 
- add a volume option for sounds

- cut some decimals off of the ping time display

- display a message when a player dies (a generic one)

- log to server console when commands are used (this includes chat, since server console doesn't display chat otherwise)

- reconsider rendering rules when player is in a hole; currently clips adjacent tiles. Check if the same happens with water.
