quick reminders / in prog stuff:

 - I think a big part of the new Tile System was *supposed* to be the ability to lump DOOR_OPEN and DOOR_CLOSED, amoung other things, into the same TileType. However, I don't seem to be doing that at all. I ought to see that it happens.
 
 - when menu system is done, add a volume option

- give item entities shadows like the water thing

- fix font handling to resize with window as before?
