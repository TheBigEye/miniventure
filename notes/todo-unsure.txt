WORLD

- backpacks

- Perhaps there should be two sorts of item entities. One type disappears quickly, and the other type lasts a lot longer. The second type could be for most valuable items. Idk if I really wanna do this though... I'm sure there are better ways.

- provide a separate control for the player to hit the ground in front of them vs hit the space in front of them; hitting the ground while something is on top will instead hit only what's on top.

UI

- have a play with colorizing server console output

- in the input settings, movement controls should be in a visually separate box, and will have two radio buttons at the top; this controls movement style: "directional", or "move to cursor"
	- for the directional style, you get an input for each direction
	- for the move to cursor style, you get a "move" input (defaults to LMB)

- Do more intense analysis of world folders and their contents. Display all folders in the "saves" folder as if they were worlds, but display different messages depending on the validity of the world; these are cumulative:
	- validates:
		- white text
		- show version
	- validates with unknown/unused files:
		- light yellow text
		- show version
		- show number of unused files
	- validates partially:
		- red text
		- show version if version present
		- disallow load
		- display missing files
	- does not validate
		- gray text
		- disallow load
		- state that folder does not contain a world
	have radio button filter ("Show:")
		- all folders
		- world folders
		- valid worlds
		set to "world folders" by default

RENDERING

- failed interaction animation - player should show indication of failed interaction.

- give item entities shadows like the water thing.
	- speaking of items, maybe, for the sake of visibility, all item sprites should have a 1-pixel black outline?
