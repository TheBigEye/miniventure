WORLD

- replace tool durability with tool sharpness. Sharpness starts in the middle, and goes down over use. Influences tool effectiveness.

- makes tiles smaller, and allow some tiletypes to occupy multiple tiles.
	- Group tile spriting should be easy, each tile just uses pixels from the structure sprite at whatever offset the tile is from the structure origin.

- lasers as a form of energy transport. Wiring could be a thing too, I suppose.

- pre-generated structures

UI

- An integrated tutorial for first-time players. Pops up at key points to tell you how to do certain things. Consists of text being drawn places on screen, maybe some arrows, and highlighted screen areas.

- For server command line console, write output to the line above the typing line, and read arrow presses to navigate command history and the current line.

RENDERING

OPTIMIZATION

- work on synchronization of packet handling; many packets can probably be processed when the player is updated
	- players will be updated at the normal time with the rest of the entities
	- movement requests will accumulate with the waiting for the player to be updated, and when the update occurs it will act like one movement request moving from the first request's start to the last request's end.
	- further sync notes in related txt file.

- I think a big part of the new Tile System was *supposed* to be the ability to lump DOOR_OPEN and DOOR_CLOSED, amoung other things, into the same TileType. However, I don't seem to be doing that at all. I ought to see that it happens.
