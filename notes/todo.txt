WORLD

- have mob AI's pursue their attacker instead of just the "nearest player." zombies, which are naturally aggressive, actually will seek out the nearest player, but will focus on one for a time if they attack it.
	- impl note, move getNearestPlayer method from Level to ServerLevel, so it can fetch the players on a level without having to go through all the entities on the level.

- add a container so players can store their items

- player armor; slots?

UI

- improve interaction inputs
	- primary action (LMB) should use what's in your hand, and secondary action (RMB) should interact with what the cursor is highlighting.
	- LMB attacks with swords and tools, but places objects. RMB opens doors and chests, gets you into bed, and presses switches.
	- for tile blueprints, RMB will put it away.

- damage bar for tiles

- validate world name; can only contain alphanum, spaces, dashes, and underscores

- add a volume option for sounds

- cut some decimals off of the ping time display

- display a message when a player dies (a generic one)

- echo player commands to server terminal (this includes the msg command)
	- "player": <command>

---

RENDERING

- reconsider rendering rules when player is in a hole; currently clips adjacent tiles. Check if the same happens with water.

---

OPTIMIZATION

- add a tiles.txt to the save format, which lists all the tiletypes in order. This will be used to convert the numbers in the rest of the island files to the correct tiletype, even if the order of the tiles changed.

- when writing tile data, check for runs of identical data, and if found, only write it once, and provide the number of times it should be repeated.
	- just add "x#:" to the start of the line, where # is the number of repetitions. LevelCache will check for this and since the line will normally start with a "(", or if there's only one tiletype then a number, the "x" will stand out as duplication specifier, and the ":" will denote where the number ends.
