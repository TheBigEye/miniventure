WORLD

- have mob AI's pursue their attacker instead of just the "nearest player." zombies, which are naturally aggressive, actually will seek out the nearest player, but will focus on one for a time if they attack it.
	- impl note, move getNearestPlayer method from Level to ServerLevel, so it can fetch the players on a level without having to go through all the entities on the level.

- add a container so players can store their items

- player armor; slots?

UI

- improve interaction inputs
	- primary action (LMB) should use what's in your hand, and secondary action (RMB) should interact with what the cursor is highlighting.
	- LMB attacks with swords and tools, but places objects. RMB opens doors and chests, gets you into bed, and presses switches.
	- for tile blueprints, RMB will put it away.

- damage bar for tiles

- validate world name; can only contain alphanum, spaces, dashes, and underscores

- add a volume option for sounds

- cut some decimals off of the ping time display

- display a message when a player dies (a generic one)

- echo player commands to server terminal (this includes the msg command)
	- "player": <command>

RENDERING

- reconsider rendering rules when player is in a hole; currently clips adjacent tiles. Check if the same happens with water.
