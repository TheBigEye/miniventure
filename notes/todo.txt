WORLD

- remove the coordinate change that makes 0,0, the center

- entities get affected by player interactions in front of the player; the cursor only determines which blocks are affected.

- remove equipped hammer from ServerPlayer; instead, add a toolkit to the crafting requirement of constructable objects, and have the crafting remove some durability

- have mob AI's pursue their attacker instead of just the "nearest player." zombies, which are naturally aggressive, actually will seek out the nearest player, but will focus on one for a time if they attack it.
	- impl note, move getNearestPlayer method from Level to ServerLevel, so it can fetch the players on a level without having to go through all the entities on the level.

- add a container so players can store their items

- player armor; slots?

- set inventory limit to 200 items

- sharply increase stamina usage and stamina recharge rate, in order to artificially reduce stamina while still keeping the refill smooth.

- add moose
    - deals two hearts of damage
    - charges in straight line at the player on sight for a distance
    - drops meat and sometimes bone from the antlers, replacing skeletons.
    - could have a charging animation
 
 - ice tile for snowy island
 
 - have Object recipes provide a bit of validation that the client can use to highlight invalid and valid choices

UI

- make the crafting screen nicer; current spacing and icon sizes don't look very nice

- improve interaction inputs
	- cursor tile highlight behavior depends on item function
		- items which can affect tiles from a distance, i.e. placeables, will have the highlight follow the cursor
		- items which affect the space in front of the player, i.e. swords, shovels, and similar tools, will keep the highlight in front of the player; or least only one tile away.
			- speaking of "in front of the player", the direction that the player is facing will sometimes depend on the cursor, and sometimes on the last directional input.
			- generally, the player direction will the directional keys, but any attack or interaction will cause the player to face toward the interaction. There is a short cooldown where the player will remain facing the cursor (even if it moves), after which direction will again be controlled by movement. If the player isn't moving, then the player will face towards the cursor.
	- primary action (LMB) should use what's in your hand, and secondary action (RMB) should interact with what the cursor is highlighting.
	- LMB attacks with swords and tools, but places objects. RMB opens doors and chests, gets you into bed, and presses switches.
	- for tile blueprints, RMB will put it away.
	
- make inventory into vertically scrollable grid. 10 slots per row?
	- at the top, display in large lettering the space being used, i.e. "43/200 items"
	- searchable and sortable

- damage bar for tiles

- add a volume option for sounds

- cut some decimals off of the ping time display

- display a message when a player dies (a generic one)

- echo player commands to server terminal (this includes the msg command)
	- "player": <command>

---

SAVE / LOAD

- when a new world will overwrite an existing one (i.e. a folder for it already exists), ask for confirmation before proceeding, at which point the folder should be deleted, and then recreated.

- validate world name; can only contain alphanum, spaces, dashes, and underscores

- when a world is too old to be compatible, display the oldest version that the current version is compatible with.

---

RENDERING

- reconsider rendering rules when player is in a hole; currently clips adjacent tiles. Check if the same happens with water.

---

OPTIMIZATION

- allow a recipe/blueprint to be passed in for DestructibleProperty ItemDrops; the costs of the recipe/blueprint will be used as the drops.

- add a tiles.txt to the save format, which lists all the tiletypes in order. This will be used to convert the numbers in the rest of the island files to the correct tiletype, even if the order of the tiles changed.

- when writing tile data, check for runs of identical data, and if found, only write it once, and provide the number of times it should be repeated.
	- just add "x#:" to the start of the line, where # is the number of repetitions. LevelCache will check for this and since the line will normally start with a "(", or if there's only one tiletype then a number, the "x" will stand out as duplication specifier, and the ":" will denote where the number ends.
