Alright, so now, this is going to specify the forms that commands can follow.

So, commands can have multiple "forms", and each form is entirely independent of any other.

Within each form, one can have a set of parameters. Before I go off the deep end with this though, I think I'll use examples so I can try to make sense, and stay on track.
	TP command
		- playertarget playerdest
		- playerdest (target is invoker)
		- playertarget x y [level] (you can't set the z coordinate)
		- x y [level] (target is invoker)
	
	CONFIG command
		- get configvalue
		- set configvalue newvalue
	
	TIME command
		- get
		- set HH:MM|timeofday
		- add HH:MM
		- sub HH:MM
	
	KILL command
		- playername
		- @entitytag [alllevels-bool] - alllevels defaults to false.
		
	GIVE command
		- [playername] item [count] - player defaults to invoker.
