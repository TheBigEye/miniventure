possible things which will have sound effects:
	- walking; maybe all mobs will have walking sounds, idk if there will be one specific to each mob. But there could be different sounds for different terrain.
	- another for wading through water.
	
	- hitting things. each tile/entity should have a sound emitted when it is attacked. There could be a default, though. And maybe another sound for when it is destroyed/killed..? Or interacted with?
	
	- picking up items. I think I'll just have a single sound that happens when you pick up an item.
	
	- menu selection change. Just for some auditory feedback.
	
	- ambient sound effects around certain tiles in general, such as running water, or a torch.
