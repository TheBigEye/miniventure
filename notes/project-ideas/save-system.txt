Global/Preferences Data:

- pick default save locations for world data, and for global preferences
- allow both locations to be customized (keep a bool for if the path is set manually, as a checkbox probably; this is in case the location changes later)
- have a global preferences menu that allows you to set things like default username, default world save location (global preferences stored here).



How to save world data:

Pretty easy, overall; world data will be stored by level first, then by chunk, and then within each chunk you have the tiles and entities within that chunk.
The tile data format is probably already made, it's probably the way that tiles are sent across from server to client.
The same is likely true for entities.



How to tracks clients:

	It was suggested that each server keeps a local repo of user profiles. when a user provides a username, the server checks if it exists. If not, it asks you to create a password, and then logs you in as a new player. If the user does already exist, it asks for a password, and if it matches the one in its folder, then it logs the player back in where they left off.
	Improvements: ask if you're a new or returning user first.
	This is a nice idea, but it's bound to get annoying with probably different usernames per server, and also terribly insecure and probably overall a bad idea, as people will be entering in what they take as passwords, which is just begging to be abused.
	
	I really think perhaps I should just figure out, or ask Shylor about, how to store the data in an online server. It seems like a much better alternative.
