make tiles smaller, so the land can have more detail.

in addition to this, create group tiles so that tile types can span multiple tiles.
Amoung others, trees will use this feature so that they can remain the same size.

Group tile spriting should be easy, each tile just uses pixels from the structure sprite at whatever offset the tile is from the structure origin.
