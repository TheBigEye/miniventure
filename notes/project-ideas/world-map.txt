islands are laid out in the map with some requirements; starter islands are close together, and the later islands are further apart.

I'll implement this by placing islands based on a minimum distance between other islands.
- boss islands must be at least 50 units from any other island
- intermediate islands must be at least 30 units from any other island
- beginner islands must be at least 10 units from any other island

there will also be a distance from starter island requirement
- boss must be furthest away
- then intermediate
- then beginner islands are closest

maybe I'll do it by placing the islands iteratively around the starter island as close as possible, starting with the beginner islands and going up. There will be a couple islands of each type at least, and the angle around the center island will vary, perhaps each placement ought to be weighted so it's more likely to be in the opposite side from the previous placement.
