	- tab is icon
	- mouse-over highlight, in addition to (non)craftable highlight
	- on click, grid cell is selected
		- right side of grid shows preview
		- crafting costs

- inventory screen
	tabs:
	- key items - i.e. maps.
		- These take no official space
		- can't drop them or lose them.
		- I'm not totally sure how to make this work well and make sense in a multiplayer game... maybe defeated bosses leave behind shrines where you can learn the secrets of the maps.
	- resources
		- these may take space; if so, they can be removed, otherwise not. They cannot be placed in the hotbar.
	- items
		- equipment, food, and small placables; these can go in the hotbar.

- storage container
	- grids

items can show with labels or alone
