With the exception of container UIs, item screens are all merged into one overlay, with an inventory tab, and a crafting tab.
- keybind E opens with the inventory selected
- keybind F opens with the crafting tab selected

tabs are similar but differ in cell style and function
- all displays list icon cells in a grid
- later: all are text field searchable

inventory and container panels
- at the top, the space usage is displayed in large lettering
- item cells may be highlighted, and clicked
	- inventory screen: clicking causes item to switch with the current hotbar selection
		- right clicking an item adds it to the first open slot in the hotbar
		- clicking a hotbar slot sets that slot as active
		- right clicking a hotbar item puts that item back into the inventory
		- later: items may be dragged between the hotbar and the inventory
			- hotbar -> inv: puts back into inventory
			- inv -> hotbar: swaps the inv item with the hotbar item
			- hotbar -> hotbar: swaps hotbar positions of items
	- container screen: clicking causes item to move to the other container
		- shift click moves only one item from a stack
		- later: right click (on a stack with more than one item) shows a slider where you choose have many items you want to move.
	

crafting panel
- has sub tabs for personal crafting, the crafting station being used (if any), and building.
	- which tab starts active depends on how the menu is reached
		- personal crafting: if the screen was pulled up normally through either the crafting shortcut, or the inventory shortcut and then changing to the crafting tab
		- crafting station: if this is the result of interacting with a crafting station
		- building: if the player right clicked with the hammer (or opens the screen with a hammer selected?)
- item cells
	- appear more as buttons
	- have a red or green coloring depending on if the player can afford the recipe
	- highlighting the cell (mouse hover) displays the invCount/cost ratio for each of the costs
		- as tooltip, or in a separate area? could use the spot the inventory screen uses for space quota display...
	- for a crafting screen: clicking a recipe crafts it once
	- for the building screen: clicking a blueprint sets it as the active blueprint, and the menu goes away
