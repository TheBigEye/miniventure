types of item screens: crafting panel, inventory panel, container panel
- similarities:
	- all display item icon cells in a grid of arbitrary scrollable height
		- items listed from left to right, top to bottom
		- height depends on number of items
	- all item icons are interactable, with selection and click highlights
		- crafting screen may apply additional highlights to show craftability
	- later: all screens are text field searchable

inventory-type panels i.e. player/container inventory, hotbar...
- items are movable; can be dragged and inserted next to any other slot
	- cannot swap; would simply have to drag twice

container screen
- centered in the middle of the screen? Or left-justified like other item screens?
- contains tab for container inv, and tab for player inv
- press "tab" to toggle between player and container inv (says this on screen)
- when viewing either screen, clicked items will be sent to the other inventory
	- a normal click sends one from a stack
	- a shift-click sends the whole stack
	- a right click provides a slider to pick how many should be sent
		- starts at half
		- rmb must remain pressed to use slider, sends when button released
		- slider tracks relative mouse position as long as rmb is held
		- left-most value is 0 to provide a way to cancel
- when viewing player inventory, hotbar items are shown first (as if they were the first items in the inventory)
	- allows these to be stored without dragging from the actual hotbar or something
- space usage of active inventory is displayed at the top in large lettering and/or a progress bar
	- "x / capacity items"
	- space usage of non-active tab is displayed somewhere on screen as well
		- perhaps next to the current one?
		- or maybe in the area were the tabs are displayed (tabs are clickable too btw as alternative to keybinds)

persistent overlay
- shows the hotbar, equipment slots, and a craft button; inventory screen can also be toggled
	- bottom row, left to right: Craft button / hammer slot, armor slot, inv space usage bar and label
		- craft button contains "craft" text on right, and hammer item slot on left; mouse events go to the slot if in bounds, else go to the button. hammer slot inherits button background, but can still use highlights.
	- hotbar directly above
	- inventory screen appears above hotbar when toggled
	- equipment slots all have a default background for when they have no item equipped
		- most are outlines of the sort of item they are expecting, like a hammer or a suit of armor
- can move items between all visible item slots; inventory screen (if toggled), hotbar, equipment slots
	- all these slots are counted toward the inventory item quota
	- equipment slots will of course have restrictions on what is allowed to go there
		- shift-clicking an equippable item from the inv screen or hotbar will auto-equip it to an appropriate equipment slot
			- if there is only one matching slot, and its full, then it will be swapped for the clicked item
			- if there are multiple matching slots, and all are full, nothing will happen (but perhaps the player will be notified in some way that all their equipment slots are full)
			- otherwise as long as there are open slots, the first open one will be used
		- shift-clicking an equipment slot will unequip the item within and return it to the inventory
	- hotbar items can be clicked to set them as the held item
		- can also use scroll wheel
- all these UI areas are made from the same underlying class
	- they're all display grids of items that point to the same inventory
	- support dragging items from one area to another, or moving them within the same area
	- may or may not have a max number of slots
		- inventory screen is the only one that has no limit
		- max of 1 slot is a special case; dragging will result in item replacement instead of insertion.
	equipment slots:
		- validation checks for items being allowed to be placed in a given area
		- listeners for when an area is modified; specifically, listen for when equipment slots are changed so that other game state may be updated accordingly, such as sprite for armor, or whatever modifiers a given accessory may activate	

crafting screen
- mutually exclusive with inventory screen; bringing this up hides the inv screen, and vice versa
- does not interact with the various slot areas on the persistent overlay
- item cells
	- appear more as buttons
	- have a red or green coloring depending on if the player can afford the recipe
	- highlighting the cell (mouse hover) displays the invCount/cost ratio for each of the costs
- content varies depending on context
	- if opened from interacting with a crafting bench
		- all item recipes that tier and below are listed
	- if opened from hotkey or craft button
		- the handmade items are listed first, followed by all the blueprint recipes for your equipped hammer tier and below
	- later: provide a tab for each bench/hammer tier in their respective situations (along with an all tab)
	- item recipes are crafted immediately in the menu and go directly back into your inventory
		- later: can choose how many to craft at once
		- later: crafting process has a delay for every item crafted
	- blueprint recipes temporarily replace your active item with a "blueprint" -- see crafting.txt
		- places objects directly into the world; entities or tiles, not items
