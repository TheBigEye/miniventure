- noise multiplexers combine noise parameter sets
- noise parameter sets hold parameters capable of creating a certain style of random noise map
	- parameters do not include width, height, or seed (but in certain cases perhaps they will and input values will be ignored)


- to create the tile map:
	1. generate the height map and vegetation map (and any others like a river map or something)
	2. go through each tile sequentially
		- determine each tile type from the bottom of the stack up, using the data from the various noise maps
	3. maybe place in some structures
