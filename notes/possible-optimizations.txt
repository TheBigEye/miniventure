I ought to spend a bit of time, now and in the future, to redo some of the code in terms of error handling. What I currently do is make sure it breaks when something unexpected happens, but what I should do (where possible) is log that there was something unexpected, and then try to recover. Making sure the game doesn't crash during play should be a priority, but the problem should still bring attention to itself; just without crashing the game.

I think a big part of the new Tile System was *supposed* to be the ability to lump DOOR_OPEN and DOOR_CLOSED, amoung other things, into the same TileType. However, I don't seem to be doing that at all. I ought to see that it happens.

It would be neat if I could find a way to bypass the server entirely for single player worlds; I would still use the packetHandlers, but the source of the packet would be directly from the client code through the server manager. The server manager might also provide the server with a method of sending back data in the initSinglePlayer method; the kyro client and server would then not be initialized.
It might be a little difficult though to then start up a server; though it shouldn't be too bad, you'd just have to pause updates while you initialized the server, and then the client, and then connected them.
