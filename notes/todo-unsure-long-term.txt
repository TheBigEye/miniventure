WORLD

- farming, and more foods like apples, different meats, bread, rice, soups and pastries. maybe other crops too.

- NPCs that sell you stuff

- Underwater world / biome: requires scuba suit to access. Can dive under in ocean biomes, and explore. Coral, new enemies, etc.

- Add tech system
    - UI section
    - lasers and more
    - electricity
    - generators

- monsters can wake you up from beds, but tents prevent that

- custom tile hitboxes

---

UI

- If you try to craft something, and you have multiple, different items which satisfy the requirements, a window will pop up asking you which of the items you want to use.

- Add little icons in a corner of the screen that show what button to press to attack and interact, and what will happen when you press those buttons, like placing a tile, attacking a mob, sleeping in a bed, etc.

RENDERING

- limited visibility; you have to explore for an area to be shown, otherwise it's black. Or, stones and stuff block the player's view.
	- Dither effect around the edges, perhaps.

- Character customization

- why not give the player an animation holding items? Or better, use the item's sprite, and just draw it in the player's hand, in each of the player's positions. It's a possible idea, but I'm skeptical.

- it would be cool if things like trees did a little shake when you attack them... maybe rocks that are not touching any others could also do it.

OPTIMIZATION

- I ought to spend a bit of time, now and in the future, to redo some of the code in terms of error handling. What I currently do is make sure it breaks when something unexpected happens, but what I should do (where possible) is log that there was something unexpected, and then try to recover. Making sure the game doesn't crash during play should be a priority, but the problem should still bring attention to itself; just without crashing the game.

- After seeing the utility of a DataMap for tile properties, I kinda wish I would have done that for everything. Sure, my previous tile system was property-based, but it had all the properties integrated into a big ol' system. I kinda like the "if has property, do action" sorta setup.
