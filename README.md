# miniventure
As of now, miniventure is still in alpha stage and probably lacks in actual gameplay, but the feature list continues to grow and change. Here's a list of the major features it has so far:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Random island generation based on a custom variant of perlin noise, among other noise algorithms
  - World save/load with compatibility tracking
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - basic world interactions, breaking/placing tiles, hurting mobs
  - mob AI behaviors
  - an update-checker that tells you when there's a new update available, and gives you the link.
  - inventory/hotbar management
  - a crafting system (with mostly tools for now) that involves making held items and objects that you place straight into the world
  - chat system with commands

Current development goals are focused around starting to flesh out the game in terms of features: mob types, item types, terrain types, crafting progression, all that good stuff.
Plans do exist for a simple storyline and perhaps a few more goals; this will be implemented soon.

If you want to know what some of the other possible goals are in terms of development, check out the files in 
[notes/next-projects](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes/next-projects). Or any of the files in 
[notes](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes) for that matter.


Note: for those goals about adding stuff, it's sort of dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and I suck at art. :P So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly appreciated. :D

#### Some other things

Miniventure started as a remake of [minicraft plus](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived), which I picked up from another modder, and has since been picked up by someone else. I originally just wanted to remake the game with a fresh start, given the complicated history of minicraft plus's codebase, and having learned a bunch from working on the project. 
However, now, miniventure has taken a direction all its own, and I fully intend to make and release it as an entirely independent game, with only basic similarities.

You can find me on the [playminicraft discord server](https://discord.me/minicraft) pretty much daily, as Chris J. There's some other mods of minicraft there too, and a couple other active modders; you can also take a look at the official [playminicraft website](https://playminicraft.com).
