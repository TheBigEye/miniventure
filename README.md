# miniventure
A remake of minicraft plus, taken in a new direction. After learning a bunch from the project, I wanted to start fresh, and try to make the best game possible. Let's see how it goes!

As of now, miniventure is still in alpha stage and probably lacks in actual gamplay, but the feature list continues to grow and change. Here's a list of the major features it has so far:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Random level generation based on perlin noise; effectively-infinite size
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - basic world interactions, breaking/placing tiles, hurting mobs
  - mob AI behaviors
  - an update-checker that tells you when there's a new update available, and gives you the link.
  - a crafting system with mostly tools
  - inventory/hotbar management
  - chat system with commands

Plans do exist for a simple storyline and perhaps a few more goals; this will be implemented soon. Along with a save system.

If you want to know what some of the other possible goals are in terms of development, check out the files in 
[notes/next-projects](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes/next-projects). Or any of the files in 
[notes](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes) for that matter.


Note: for those goals about adding stuff, it's sort of dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and I suck at art. :P So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D

You can find me on the [playminicraft discord server](https://discord.me/minicraft) pretty much daily, as Chris J. There's some other mods of minicraft there too, and a couple other active modders; or you can take a look at the official [playminicraft website](https://playminicraft.com).
