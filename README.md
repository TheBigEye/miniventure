# miniventure
Having started as a remake of [minicraft plus](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived), I originally just wanted to start fresh, after learning a bunch from the project. However, now, miniventure has taken a direction all its own, and I fully intend to make and release it as an entirely independent game, with only basic similarities.

As of now, miniventure is still in alpha stage and probably lacks in actual gameplay, but the feature list continues to grow and change. Here's a list of the major features it has so far:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Random island generation based on a custom variant of perlin noise, among other noise algorithms
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - basic world interactions, breaking/placing tiles, hurting mobs
  - mob AI behaviors
  - an update-checker that tells you when there's a new update available, and gives you the link.
  - a crafting system (with mostly tools for now)
  - inventory/hotbar management
  - chat system with commands

Plans do exist for a simple storyline and perhaps a few more goals; this will be implemented soon. Along with a save system.

If you want to know what some of the other possible goals are in terms of development, check out the files in 
[notes/next-projects](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes/next-projects). Or any of the files in 
[notes](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes) for that matter.


Note: for those goals about adding stuff, it's sort of dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and I suck at art. :P So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D

You can find me on the [playminicraft discord server](https://discord.me/minicraft) pretty much daily, as Chris J. There's some other mods of minicraft there too, and a couple other active modders; or you can take a look at the official [playminicraft website](https://playminicraft.com).
